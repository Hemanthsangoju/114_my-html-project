      <p>
        I always beleve that every dream has different ways to achieve it.
        <br> When we are running to achive our dreams,paths should always fill will your hardwork, luck, respect,happiness.
        <br> The journey which you came through only will give you respect.
        <br> A Dreams or goals should set based on our choice not based on our situation.
        <br> Patience is very important to achieve something.
        <br> I always beleive in myself that i can over come any situation.
        <br> When i am doing some work, some point of time i will get feeling like i don't think that i can finish this.
        <br> The next moment i will think about my dreams no i will do it yes it is tough but i will overcome it.
        <br> One day everyone will achieve, don't wait for the day work for the day.
